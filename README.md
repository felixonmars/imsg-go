This package provides a method for interacting with OpenBSD's [imsg](https://man.openbsd.org/imsg_init)
IPC messaging. Communication via imsg commonly occurs between privilege separated processes over a
stream-oriented Unix domain socket. Examples of imsg usage can be found in several utilities
including OpenBSD's [vmm](https://man.openbsd.org/vmm)/[vmd](https://man.openbsd.org/vmd)/[vmctl](https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl),
[OpenBGPD](https://www.openbgpd.org/), and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

## Stability
This package is pre-v1 and as such, currently provides no stability guarantees. Go 1.17 and above are supported.
